> - CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.

> - Monitoring and Alerts: Implement monitoring and alerting for the application to ensure high availability and reliability. Use monitoring tools and techniques relevant to the project.

> - User Feedback and Iteration: Gather user feedback and continuously iterate on the application to improve the user experience.
